# Quicksilver

A modern React-based email client implementing the Email 2.0 vision.

## The Vision: Email 2.0

Email 2.0 reimagines email as something an order of magnitude more productive and user-friendly than current email systems. The vision integrates:

- **Modern messaging UX**: Conversational UI with threads that can compete with WhatsApp in simplicity
- **Security & Privacy by Design**: Built-in identity, authentication, and privacy features
- **Roles & Groups**: Support for individual users, organizational roles, and temporary assignments
- **Multilingual Support**: Sinhala and Tamil language support with translation
- **Offline-First**: Reliable functionality even with flaky connectivity
- **Smart Organization**: AI-powered categorization beyond folders and labels
- **Integrated Workflows**: First-class support for attachments, calendars, tasks, and forms

See [docs/Email-2.md](docs/Email-2.md) for the complete vision.
